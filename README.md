BLOCKCHAIN CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES: Review Paper
Abstract— 


Trust and Integrity are two parallel lines that can’t be interchanged or compromised in the world of technology. Considering the importance of trust, integrity can be maintained in a distributed system but with some factors in consideration hence Blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized data management concept, with an immutable feature of causing a positive disruption in our day to day transactions. In a simple tense, it is a set of blocks that contains information. Blockchain technology application can be deployed in all sectors ranging from financial services, telecommunication, internet of things, cryptocurrency, risk management etc. A number of studies on blockchain outlined security and scalability as the main challenge. However, this review paper will address the two aforementioned challenges, show the milestone done in addressing the challenges, x-ray the birth and origin of blockchain compared to the traditional data base, show the opportunities blockchain technology has enabled, what could be the obstacles to blockchain adoption in the 21st world and conclude with the risk blockchain will expose the existing solutions and enterprises if adopted. 



I.	INTRODUCTION 
Blockchain technology and techniques all begin with a group of researches in 1991, who wanted to implement a document digital with no possibility of tampering in any form such as backdating or making changes when compared to a notary. They were successful though it was not talked about either was it used. In 2009, the same technology was adopted by Satochi Nakamoto in creating digital cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin.
 All of this was in a quest to breach the challenges that the internet has created and what do I mean?
The internet has brought a lot of fortunes, in a bit to recognize that, it will still us to know that 50% of the population are yet to connect to the internet. This has drastically affected humanity in all areas ranging from how we learn, communicate, work, etc. The industries are not left out in this great impact, because comparing the traditional way of getting information, how we manage and control our finances, with invents of social media (Facebook, Twitter), online dating, etc. 
There is this school of thought that postulated that the disruptive days of is still ahead that it is just a scratch. From the surface, it is easy to focus on the positive side of the internet and the ease it has brought to the world such as low cost of communication (WhatsApp), creating a global investment online, modern ways of accessing health information and services where there is no doctor at site, (NHS) without considering that big networks are not big without them facing their problems squarely.
Aside from what we know, such as system virus, fraudulent activities online, fake news hacking, social media trolling, etc, the internet still faces the challenge of trust and hence struggles. The recurrent questions mostly when we do business online with a stranger will always be, is the person am doing business really who they say they are? Are these services or promotions real etc? When trust issues are addressed, then such systems are termed to be health.
When we consider system authentication techniques such as user name and password, two-factor authentication, firewalls intrusion detection systems, biometrics, CAPTCHA, etc, we still get hacked. Our database system becomes compromised daily, unavailable, money and identities are stolen, confidence in using the internet stiffens. If we desire more from the internet such as online voting mechanism, digital currencies, machine to machine communication such as self-driven cars, trains, seamless ways of authenticating identity and more, then we need a system that conquers the issue of trust and a lot more. Bitcoin currency has proven that such a system is possible to change the game of security and trust and bitcoin operates on blockchain technology [1][3]. If we ever desire the giant stride with a positive disruption using the internet, then blockchain is the key.
The goal of blockchain technology is to decentralize a system that is void of the third party in control of any transaction. The information for any transaction is made know to all the nodes and it makes the system more transparent. The decentralized nature requires a lot of core technologies such as digital signature, distributed consensus mechanism, and cryptographic hash. With all the above mentioned, it can save cost and improve efficiency [2].
Application of blockchain can be deployed in digital remittance and online payment [4], smart contracts [5], in public sectors[6], deployment in the internet of things need it[7], security service sector [8] just to mention but a few.
All of these were pictured from bitcoin and it clearly shows that there are still technical limitations of blockchain that need to be addressed. 
The first limitation is scalability. The single block size is 1MB. If we consider the high frequency of trading per second, it clearly shows that the decentralized nature of blockchain may not be sustained. It means that only a few people will like to keep up with such a large number of data.
The second challenge observed is the selfish nature of miners. Miners may want to hide mined block for future use all geared towards generating more revenue and solutions are around this already. Thirdly, proof of work and stake as shown to be a great challenge in the area of energy and it establishes the concept of the rich getting rich and the poor getting poor.
This literature review focuses on blockchain technology and the rest of this paper will discuss
Section II Blockchain architecture and its consensus algorithms,
Section III Blockchain Disruptive Nature and Possibility's,
Section IV Potential obstacle in blockchain adaption,
Section V Recommendation and Conclusion. This template, modified in MS Word 2007 and saved as a “Word

V.	CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
Blockchain is gaining momentum. Drawing a lesion form Kevin Kelly the author of “The Inevitable” in 1990 when the internet was introduced. People kicked against it complaining that people will not trust or buy any of their products online, but today the big players like Amazon are making waves in the industry. Blockchain is a technology that has come to stay and it is good to know those big industries such as MasterCard, Bank of America, and Commonwealth bank of Australia are already diving into blockchain projects. The area I recommend for more research or open for more research is on privacy risk issues associated with blockchain. This covers insurance in case of a failed blockchain transaction.
